# Rundeck For Android

  The objectives of the proposed system is to provide an application which can
run on Android platform which enables users to access Infrastructure Workflow
orchestration and automation scripts through Android Devices which would benefit
in multiple ways. To setup the server automation and workflow orchestration tool to
execute/schedule jobs from one place and also to make the workflow orchestration
tool user-friendly and mobile. This system provides ad-hoc support and coverage on
IT automation in-order to ensure high availability and adherence on the
deliverables.
  
  The Scope of the project is to provide a UI Layer and integration layer which
would attach itself to an existing workflow orchestration engine and execute steps
as directed. The essential functionalities identified only are ported into the android
application for user interaction keeping security concerns in mind.
